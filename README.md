# VideoAdBlockForTwitch

Swaps Twitch video ads for an ad-free stream between 1080p and 480p quality and then automatically switches back to original quality once the ad is done.

This is all done locally, so no VPN's, Proxies or third party websites.

You must remove any Twitch related userscripts or other Twitch specific ad block extensions to prevent conflicts. You can use this extension with other major ad blockers though.
